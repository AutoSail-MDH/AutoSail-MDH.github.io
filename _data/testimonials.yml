  testimonial: "I am an easy-going guy that always says what he thinks. Being the youngest member of the team I have spent my entire life behind a school desk so this project for me represents a chance to make use of what I have learned and create something from scratch. If my time within this team is any indication of what it’s like working as an engineer then I am excited for the rest of my life."

My interests lie with hardware more than software as it relates to engineering. On my free time I am a dedicated floorball keeper for Rönnby Västerås and play in the second highest league in Sweden."
